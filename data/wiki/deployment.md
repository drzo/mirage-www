This live MirageOS website is written as a MirageOS application itself, with the
source code on [mirage/mirage-www](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www) on
GitHub. Our workflow is such that we can send a
[pull request](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed)
to update the website, and have a fully standalone unikernel
deployed at <https://mirageos.org/>.

See <https://github.com/ocurrent/ocurrent-deployer> for the deployment pipeline.
